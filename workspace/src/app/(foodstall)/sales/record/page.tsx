// ERROR: THIS FILE IS IN A CONFLICTING ROUTE GROUP (foodstall)
// AND IS CAUSING A "You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path" ERROR.
//
// TO FIX THIS:
// 1. ENSURE THE CORRECT PAGES EXIST UNDER THE /src/app/foodstall/ DIRECTORY (WITHOUT PARENTHESES).
// 2. MANUALLY DELETE THE ENTIRE /src/app/(foodstall)/ DIRECTORY FROM YOUR PROJECT.
//
// This file's content is intentionally minimal to try and avoid build errors,
// but the directory structure itself is the primary cause of the conflict.

export default function ConflictingFoodstallRecordSalePage() {
  return null; // Returning null to make it non-functional as a page.
}
