// THIS FILE IS PART OF A CONFLICTING ROUTE GROUP (foodstall) AND SHOULD BE MANUALLY DELETED.
// Next.js is detecting this page at a path that conflicts with your main app's /expenses/record (if any)
// or the intended /foodstall/expenses/record.
//
// TO FIX THE "You cannot have two parallel pages that resolve to the same path" ERROR:
// 1. Ensure all intended food stall pages are under `/src/app/foodstall/...` (no parentheses).
// 2. Manually delete the entire `/src/app/(foodstall)/` directory from your project.
//
// This file's content is intentionally minimal to try and avoid build errors,
// but the directory structure itself is the primary cause of the conflict.

export default function ConflictingFoodstallRecordExpensePage() {
  return null; // Returning null to make it non-functional as a page.
