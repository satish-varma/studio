// This file is intentionally blank.
// Mock data has been removed as the application now fetches data from Firebase Firestore.
// For this application to work, you must:
// 1. Set up a Firebase project.
// 2. Enable Firestore and configure your database.
// 3. Create the necessary collections (e.g., 'users', 'stockItems', 'salesTransactions').
// 4. Populate these collections with initial data if needed.
// 5. Configure Firebase Security Rules to allow appropriate read/write access.
//    - Example: Allow authenticated users to read 'stockItems'.
//    - Example: Allow authenticated users to write to 'salesTransactions' (and update 'stockItems' via transactions).
//    - Example: Allow users to read their own user document in the 'users' collection.
//    - Example: Allow admins/managers to read all user documents if needed for features like staff filtering.
